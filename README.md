Work in progress.

Idea is that you put `display: flex` and this plugin will polyfill it correctly so it will use flex in new browsers and tables in old browsers.

No tests yet. Not passing lint. Those are forthcoming. Way too many `console.log`s in the code. No good error handling. Massive refactor still to come (the code sucks.)

IE this code is production ready. :joy:
